Ocean model validation made easy in Python.

To learn more about the package, visit the [OceanVal website](https://pmlmodelling.github.io/OceanVal/). The

OceanVal is designed for the automated creation of validation reports. You provide the model and validation data. OceanVal does the rest. A short example of what the report looks like can be found [here](https://pmlmodelling.github.io/oceanval_example/index.html). 

## Running OceanVal from the terminal

The browser window is in the development version only (`main`), not yet in a tagged
release; there is a [page and demo video on the website](https://pmlmodelling.github.io/OceanVal/browser.html).

The quickest way needs no Python at all. In a terminal, in the directory to
work in, run `oceanval` (or `OceanVal`). A page opens in your web browser
that takes you through these steps:

1. **Choose** to match up new data and validate it, to match up only, or to
   validate matchups made earlier.
2. **Simulation**: where the model output is, how many directories down its
    files are, which files to skip or keep (the file filters), and the domain.
    Type the directory, with folders suggested as you go, or pick
   it with **Browse…**, which looks through the folders on the machine
   OceanVal runs on, so it works on a remote machine too. As you type, the
    page counts the files that pass the filters. The next page starts with
    years inferred from their names, which you can change there. It also asks
    where to save the matchups and the report: the
   directory you started `oceanval` in, unless you choose another. To
   validate matchups made earlier, you choose the report's options instead.
3. **Own data**: whether you have observations of your own, as well as
   OceanVal's built-in datasets. If you do, a page for point data (csv
   files) and one for gridded data (netCDF) let you add them one at a time,
   with every argument of `add_point_comparison` or `add_gridded_comparison`;
   the ones that have to be given are marked in red. Skip a page if you have
   none of that kind. The calls are written into the matchup script.
4. **Recipes**: the recipes window, to check the model
   variables found and choose the observations to validate against. A
   dataset validated through the water column (Vertical) needs a thickness
   before you can carry on.
5. **Units**: a table of the units of every gridded and point matchup, read
   from the model's netCDF files and, for the observations, from the recipes
   (the Units column of the recipes page) or from your own netCDF file. Where
   OceanVal thinks they differ, it suggests a multiplier and an adder for the
   observations, in red and bold, and says what it assumed, such as a seawater
   density of 1025 kg/m³ between per kilogram and per volume. It can get this
   wrong, so check every row, and fill in any it could not work out. Your own
   point data is csv files, which have no units, so it is up to you to make
   sure they match the model's. The units always have to be confirmed, with a
   box under the tables, before the button starts the matchup. The
   conversions are written into the matchup script as `obs_multiplier` and
   `obs_adder`.
6. **Files**: the page says it is identifying the files that meet your
   criteria, then shows what it found as a table: each variable, its model
   variable, the observations it is compared with and the files it is in,
   with **List all files** for each (OceanVal applies temporal subsetting to
   them). Carry on if the matchups are right; No stops the run; **Back**
   stops it too, before anything is matched up, and goes back to the units.
7. **Report** (to match up and validate): "One last thing... How would you
   like your validation report?" The report's options, asked for before
   anything is matched up: a subregion to validate, regional summaries,
   a transect to validate the gridded datasets along (a start and an end
   longitude and latitude, which must run north-south or east-west, and the
   page does not let you carry on otherwise), fixed colour scales, PDF and
   Word versions, a zipped copy, a concise or detailed report, and, if a
   point dataset is matched up with Vertical, the depth bins its depth
   summaries use (each can be changed or removed, and more added). The
   report is built beside the matchups, in the
   directory chosen in step 2. **Back** shows the matchups again, and keeps
   the options. The options are written into the matchup script's
   `validate()` call.
8. **Run**: matchup, then, to validate as well, `validate()` with the
   report's options. The output appears as it comes, in the page and in the
   terminal, and anything else OceanVal asks, such as whether to try again
   for observations a server could not supply, is asked in the page. With
   jupyter-book 2 or later, the matchup builds an interim validation report
   as it goes: the page says "Interim validation report is being generated.
   Please wait..." until the first matchup's page is in it, then links to
   it. Each matchup's page is added as soon as the matchup is made, and the
   full report (with PDF and Word, if asked for) is built once they all are.
   The finished page links to the full report.

Every step after the first has **Back**, which keeps what you have entered:
get as far as the report's options, spot a mistake, go back as far as the
simulation to fix it, and carry on with everything else as you left it.
Whatever you change replaces what was there, in the steps after it too. The
recipes window comes back as you left it; go back before it, and the
simulation is read again, so the window keeps your global settings and the
rows you changed whose model variables are still in the output, ticks the
datasets afresh if you changed the domain, and says in red and bold what it
could not keep. The units always have to be confirmed again. Once anything
is matched up, there is no going back.

Closing the browser window quits `oceanval` in the terminal, within about 15
seconds, stopping anything it is running, whichever browser you use. So do
**Quit** (which is instant) and Ctrl+C.

Outside the window, `matchup(live_validation=...)` builds the same interim
report (HTML only, in `oceanval_interim_report`), with `True` or a dict of
`validate()`'s report options, before `validate()` builds the full report:

```python
oceanval.matchup(sim_dir="/path/to/output", start=2000, end=2010,
                 live_validation={"lon_lim": [-20, 10], "lat_lim": [40, 65]})
oceanval.validate(lon_lim=[-20, 10], lat_lim=[40, 65], pdf=True)
```

To see how it works first, choose **Try a demo**, below the four choices on
the first page. It downloads a CMIP6 climate model's sea surface temperature,
sea surface salinity and surface nitrate (NorESM2-LM, 50 MB) and takes you
through the same steps with the options filled in, in red and bold, matching
2010 up with COBE-SST 2 (temperature) and the World Ocean Atlas 2023 (salinity
and nitrate). The units step suggests converting the observed nitrate, which
you check as you would for your own model. It shows
how OceanVal works, not how to validate a climate model, which needs many
years of output rather than one. It creates a directory called
`oceanval_demo`, with the data, matchups and report in it: remove it when you
have finished.

The script it runs is written first, to `matchup.py` unless you choose
another name, so you can run it again later with `python matchup.py`. On a
remote machine, open the link `oceanval` prints: VS Code forwards its port
for you, and over plain SSH, `oceanval --port 8765` picks a port to forward.

## Using built-in recipes

You can register a standard observation climatology without manually listing all metadata:

```python
import oceanval

oceanval.add_gridded_comparison(
    name="temperature",
    source="WOA23",
    model_variable="temp",
    recipe={"temperature": "woa23"},
    start=2005,
    end=2014,
    climatology=True,
)
```

This uses the v0.2.0 recipe system for datasets such as WOA23, NSBC, OCCCI and GLODAP.

There are also point (in-situ) recipes — currently on `main`, not yet in a
tagged release — from the [ICES Oceanographic database](https://ocean.ices.dk)
covering temperature, salinity, alkalinity, ammonium, chlorophyll, nitrate,
oxygen, pH, phosphate and silicate. Rather than reading csv files, they
download the observations during `matchup`, for the years being matched and
the `lon_lim`/`lat_lim` area (or the model's own extent); see the
[recipes page](https://pmlmodelling.github.io/OceanVal/recipes.html#point-recipes)
for the full list with units:

```python
oceanval.add_point_comparison(
    model_variable="votemper",
    recipe={"temperature": "ices"},
    vertical=True,
)
```

Point matchups made through the water column are summarised by depth in the
report, by default in 0-10, 10-30, 30-60, 60-100, 100-150, 150-300, 300-600,
600-1000 and >1000 m. `validate()` takes your own as `[min, max]` pairs in
metres, with a max of `None` for everything below the deepest:

```python
oceanval.validate(depth_bins=[[0, 20], [20, 200], [200, None]])
```

### Generating a matchup script

> **Deprecated:** `create_recipes` will be removed in a future release, and
> warns when called. Run the `oceanval` command instead, which opens the same
> window and goes on to run the matchup and the report.

`create_recipes` writes the script for you. It scans your model output,
works out which model variable holds each observational variable — matching
on the netCDF `long_name` attributes, so your variables need not be named
after the observations — and writes out every built-in gridded recipe.
Recipes it found a model variable for are live, with that variable filled
in; any it could not identify are commented out for you to complete by
hand, unless you fill them in first in the window described below. If
your output looks like raw FVCOM output (an unstructured mesh), it first
asks you to confirm that, then writes `fvcom=True` into the script's
`matchup()` call — pass `fvcom=True` or `fvcom=False` to skip the
question. Where a variable has a recipe in more than one region (e.g. temperature), `domain`
picks which one is left live — `"global"` or `"nwes"` (Northwest European
Shelf) — and a variable with a recipe only outside that domain still gets
that one. `domain="nwes"` also adds the ICES point recipes (see above) —
they have no global equivalent, so they're left out entirely for
`domain="global"` rather than written out commented.

```python
import oceanval

oceanval.create_recipes(
    simdir="/path/to/model/output",
    ndown=2,   # how many directories down the output files sit
    out="matchup.py",
    domain="global",
    start=2005,   # passed straight through to matchup()
    end=2014,
)
```

Before the script is written, a page opens in your web browser so you can
check and change all of this. It has a row for each observational
variable, holding the model variable identified for it (which you can
change) and tick-boxes for the gridded and point datasets available for
it. They start ticked as the script would otherwise be written; tick
several to validate a variable against each of them, or use **Clear all
selections** to untick everything and start from none. Each ticked dataset
can be given years of its own, and the ones whose observations are
resolved in depth (WOA23, NSBC and ICES) can be set to Vertical, to
validate the full water column rather than the surface alone.

Pass `gui=False` to write the script straight away, e.g. in a batch job.
`create_recipes` then asks in the terminal for the model variable of
anything it could not identify (press Enter to skip, or pass `ask=False`).
With `validate=False`, the script's `validate()` call is written commented
out, to build the report once the matchups are made. `exclude` and `require`
leave out output files by name, as `matchup()` does (e.g. `exclude="5d"`),
and are passed on to the script's `matchup()` call.

## Comparing multiple validation outputs

To compare validation reports from multiple simulations:

```python
import oceanval

oceanval.compare(
    model_dict={
        "model_a": "/path/to/model_a",
        "model_b": "/path/to/model_b",
    },
    view=True,
    ask=True,
)
```

This recreates the v0.2.0 comparison workflow and writes the shared comparison report to `oceanval_comparison/compare/_build/html/index.html`.

# Installation 

OceanVal should be used with Python versions 3.10-3.13.

You can install the latest release OceanVal from conda-forge as follows:

```sh
conda install conda-forge::oceanval
```

You can install the development version of OceanVal from GitHub using the following steps.

First, clone this directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pmlmodelling/oceanval.git
```

Then move to this directory.
