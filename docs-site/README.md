# OceanVal website

Source for the OceanVal marketing/documentation site (`docs-site/` in the main
oceanVal repository). Plain static HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no dependencies.

## Previewing locally

```sh
cd docs-site
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

Deployment is automated by `.github/workflows/pages.yml` (at the repository
root, not under `docs-site/`), which publishes this directory as-is (no build
step) whenever a push to `main` touches `docs-site/**`.

To turn it on:

1. In the repo's **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**
   (not "Deploy from a branch").
2. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually from the **Actions** tab —
   it has `workflow_dispatch` enabled). The site publishes to
   `https://<org>.github.io/<repo>/`.

If your default branch isn't `main`, update the `branches:` list in the
workflow file to match.

The included `.nojekyll` file stops GitHub Pages from running its default
Jekyll processing, which isn't needed here and can interfere with files/paths
starting with an underscore.

## Updating content

Page content is authored by hand to match the current oceanVal docs
(`docs/source/*.rst` and the package README) — there's no templating engine,
so if the underlying package docs change, update the corresponding `.html`
file(s) directly. Shared header/nav/footer markup is duplicated across pages
(no static-site generator), so a nav or footer change should be applied to
all nine `.html` files.
