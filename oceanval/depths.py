"""The depth bins of the point validation: validate()'s depth_bins option.

Point matchups made through the water column (vertical=True) are summarised
in depth ranges, on each point page (data/point_template.ipynb) and in the
summary (data/summary.ipynb). Each bin is a [min, max] pair of depths in
metres, and the deepest may have no max (None), for everything below its
min. A depth is in a bin if min < depth <= max, and the shallowest bin also
takes a depth equal to its min, so that 0 m is in the first bin (and, if it
starts at 0 m, anything recorded above the surface). Bins may
leave gaps, and observations in a gap are left out, but may not overlap.
