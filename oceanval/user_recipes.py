"""Data recipes of your own, kept in a ``.oceanvalrc`` file.

OceanVal's own recipes, e.g. ``recipe={"chlorophyll": "occci"}``, are built
in. The recipes you register are kept in JSON files, and used the same way,
by the key your source is known by: a source called ``MySat`` for chlorophyll
is ``recipe={"chlorophyll": "mysat"}``.

Two files are read. ``.oceanvalrc`` in the directory OceanVal runs from holds
the recipes for that directory, and ``.oceanvalrc`` in your home directory (or
the file the ``OCEANVALRC`` environment variable names, if it is set) holds
those for everywhere. Where the same recipe is in both, the directory's wins.

This module only reads and writes the files, and finds and checks recipes
for OceanVal's other modules. It imports nothing else from OceanVal, so that
oceanval.parsers can use it. Checking the data a recipe points at is in
oceanval.recipe_checks.
