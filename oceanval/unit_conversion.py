"""How to turn observations into the model's units, for the oceanval window's
units step.

suggest() compares the units of a matchup's observations with the model's and,
where it can tell, works out the obs_multiplier and obs_adder that turn one into
the other: observations x multiplier + adder.

The arithmetic is pint's, but pint cannot be given units as model files and
observation datasets write them. It reads the element in "mmol P/m^3" as poise
and the one in "mmol N/m^3" as newton, and cannot read "degrees_C", "1e-3" or
"micromoles_per_kilogram" at all. So each unit is read here first, word by word,
against the short list of units ocean concentrations are given in, and anything
else is left for the user to check. Some conversions need more than units, too:
a seawater density between per kilogram and per volume, the micromoles in a
millilitre of oxygen, for oxygen in ml/l, and an equivalent taken as a mole, for
alkalinity. Salinity and pH are never converted: 1, 1e-3 and psu are the same
scale of salinity, and pH has no units.
