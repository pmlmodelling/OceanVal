"""What OceanVal remembers of your earlier work, kept in a ``.oceanvalcache`` file.

For now that is the simulation directories you have matched up, which the
oceanval window offers again when you set up a run.

The file is in your home directory (or is the file the ``OCEANVALCACHE``
environment variable names, if it is set). OceanVal never ships it and does not
create it until there is something to remember, so installing or upgrading
OceanVal leaves an existing file as it is. When something is added the whole
file is read and written again, so what is already in it is kept; a file that
cannot be read is left alone, and nothing is added to it.

A cache must never stop a run, so nothing here raises.
