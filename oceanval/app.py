"""The oceanval command: OceanVal in a window in your web browser.

Run ``oceanval`` (or ``OceanVal``) in a terminal, in the directory to work
in, and a page opens in your web browser that takes you through:

1. choosing to match up new data and validate it, to match up only, or to
   validate matchups made earlier;
2. the simulation to match up, which create_recipes then reads - or, to
   validate only, the options for validate();
3. the create_recipes window, whose button then starts the matchup rather
   than only writing the script;
4. the run: the script create_recipes wrote, or validate(), in a process of
   its own (see oceanval.app_child). The page shows its output as it comes,
   which is printed in the terminal too, and asks any question it asks.
   To match up and validate, once the matchups are checked, a last step
   asks for the report's options before anything is matched up, and
   validate() is run with them after the script. matchup builds an interim
   report with them as it goes (see oceanval.live), which the page links
   to once its first page is made.

Every step after the first has Back, until anything is matched up, and
what was entered in a step is kept for when it is reached again: the
recipes window is shown again as it was left, and Back from the matchups
stops the run, which is waiting for its answer, for the units step (see
App.back).

Like the create_recipes window (see oceanval.recipes_gui), the page is
served only on 127.0.0.1, only to requests carrying the random token in its
link, and loads nothing from anywhere else. It serves the reports too, the
interim one and the full one, so that they open from the page, which a
file:// link would not, and over a forwarded port.
